Utility for packaging executables with their required libraries & resources

Output is a C file with compressed base 64 strings which are extracted into temp folder on first run, then the executable is run from the temp directory.

Only seems to work if you compile the output with the Tiny C Compiler, segfaults when I tried with GCC I assume because the base64 strings are MB's long. submit a PR if you know the solution

public domain aside from miniz header
