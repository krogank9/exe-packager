Utility for packaging executables with their required libraries & resources

Output is a C file with compressed base 64 strings which are extracted into temp folder on first run, then the executable is run from the temp directory.

only seems to work with tiny C compiler, segfaults when I tried with GCC I assume because the base64 strings are MB's long. submit a PR if you know the solution
