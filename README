Utility for packaging executables with their required libraries & resources

Output is a C file with compressed base 64 strings which are extracted into temp folder on first run, then the executable is run from the temp directory.

Only seems to work if you compile the output with the Tiny C Compiler, segfaults when I tried with GCC I assume because the base64 string literals are MB's long. submit a PR if you know the solution

compile with qmake && make or import to qt creator

public domain aside from miniz header, whose requirement is satisifed by printf'ing its license on start. you are free to redistribute/use it source/binary no need for credit
